# Bug Budgeter

This tool is meant to assist me (Benjamin Smedberg) to prioritize bugs that I am responsible for on bugzilla.mozilla.org. It allows me to track and assign bug priorities, see ownership and recent activity on bugs, as well as track the status of patches and reviews.

Right now the list of bugzilla components is hard-coded. If you're interested in using this tool to triage other modules, I'd love to make the list of modules configurable!
